 4. Autoscaling: Make use of auto-scaling at peak and scale down to the bare minimum.

 5. Time-shift cron jobs: Scheduling workloads to execute, when electricity carbon intensity is low or execute in green regions if time critical.

 6. Utilise code optimisation techniques. Optimise code to reduce processing time and resource usage, lowering cloud infrastructure demands.

 7. Integrate sustainability metrics into software development KPIs.

 8. Optimise code for efficiency: Regularly review and refactor your code to reduce resource consumption, promoting a greener software development process.

 9. Review cloud provider sustainability reports: Assess their commitment to renewable energy and energy efficiency.

 10. Embrace serverless architecture: Leverage cloud-based serverless platforms to scale resources dynamically, minimising energy waste and maximising efficiency in your applications.

 11. Extend your hardware life: Extend your hardware life to reduce your embodied carbon footprint.

 12. Use optimised libraries: Make use of prevalent libraries in your codebase, they've likely been optimised beyond what a single person/team could do.
